This directory contains support for the msp430 basic clock (__MSP430_HAS_BASIC_CLOCK) and
basic clock plus (__MSP430_HAS_BC2_).  These are clock modules provided  by 1st gen x1xxx
processors and 2nd gen x2xxx processors (ie. msp430f2618 etc).

The hardware configuration is assumed to include a 32768 Hz external clock crystal that
is used as an accurate timebase.  This timebase is used to syncronize internal clocks
and provides clocking for the primary time base.   This provides timer clocking while
the processor is sleeping.

x1: msp430f1611,     TA3 and TB7.
x2: msp430f261[6-9], TA3 and TB7.

By default, TA is wired to the 32KiHz timebase and TB is wired to a 1MiHz timebase.

Other msp430 x1/x2 family chips will have various mixtures of TA and TB.
