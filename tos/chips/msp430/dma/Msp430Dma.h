 *
 * Major rewrite: 4/4/2011 (is that US or European order?)
 * Rewrite to support the x1, x2, and x5 families, single driver.
 *
 *
 * - Make a minimal driver.  Only include what is actually used and no more.
 *   Simplify what one needs to pay attention to and what needs to be
 *   supported.
 *
 * - Remove internal state variable.   Make the h/w be the keeper of the faith.
 *   This is fine as long as the h/w tells the truth.  If we think in the
 *   future that there is an issue with the h/w then we will need to revisit
 *   this.  This also works because there is no write only h/w nonsense.
 *
 * - Eliminate redefinition of h/w defines in Msp430Dma.h.   Rather force use
 *   of the h/w defines provided by cpu headers (ie. msp430/include/
 *   msp430f1611.h).  This allows us to adapt the code for different processors
 *   (ie. x1 vs x2 vs x5) without having our own processor dependent files we
 *   have to find.
 *
 *
 * - DMA OpControl
 *
 *   each DMA Controller (as opposed to a DMA Channel) has 3 bits that control
 *   certain parameters of the overall DMA operations.
 *
 *   x1/x2: DMAONFETCH, ROUNDROBIN, and ENNMI.
 *   x5:    DMARMWDIS,  ROUNDROBIN, and ENNMI.
 *
 *   These are set via (HplMsp430DmaControlP) DmaControl.   We default to all
 *   off.  This can be overridden by use of the DmaControl.setOpControl
 *   interface.  Note: turning on DMAONFETCH or DMARMWDIS will slow the DMA
 *   down but possibly avoids DMA/cpu interaction side effects.
 *
 *
 * - 3 vars control Trigger Select.
 *
 *   TSEL_BASE:		address of control word.   Indicates where trigger
 *			select for a given DMA channel lives.
 *   TSEL_SHIFT:	Any shift needed (left shift) to find where TSEL starts.
 *   TSEL_MASK:		Mask denoting how wide TSEL is (4 or 5 bits).
 *
 *   These are established when creating a DMA channel via HplMsp430DmaChannelP.
 *
 *   WARNING: Care must be taken when accessing the control cells where TSEL lives.
 *   On the x1 and x2 processors, these control cells live in the 16 bit i/o memory
 *   starting at 0x0100.  This area MUST be accessed using only 16 bit instructions,
 *   ie. mov not mov.b.    mov.b to an odd IO16 address does nothing.   mov.b to
 *   an even IO16 will do strange things.  Only use full 16 bit instructions.
 *
 *   There are one or more TSEL words.  These words get zeroed on a full reset of
 *   the DMA engines.   The x1 and x2 dma engine (using 4 bit TSEL fields) have one
 *   TSEL word and all 3 TSEL fields fit in this word.   The x5 dma engine uses
 *   5 bit TSEL fields and has 2 TSEL words.   We define TSELW_x for each TSEL
 *   control word that exists for the processor.   These are used in the reset
 *   routine that hits all the engines.
 *
 *
 * - Interrupt Vector
 *
 *   The x1 processors have no DMAIV register, so determining which dma engine
 *   is interrupting has do be done by hand.  The x2 and x5 processors provide
 *   the DMAIV register which indicates which channel is interrupting.
 *
 * - DMA Channel Control is the same across all three processor families.
 *
 * - DMA trigger values are provided by the dma_trigger_t enum.  It changes
 *   for the different processor being selected.   The names are carefully
 *   chosen so a compile error will be generated if used on processor where
 *   the trigger value isn't supported.
