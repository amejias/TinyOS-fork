/*
 * SPI1: SPI/USCI_B1.  Defaults to no DMA.
 *
 * On the x2xxx processors, USCI_B1 does not have any DMA triggers available
 * on the DMA engine so SPI1 does not support DMA.  Note....  This only
 * applies for the x2xxx processors.  x5xxx processors have more triggers so
 * can support DMA.  How to handle.
 *
 * This argues for this being a platform thing.  The platform indicates
 * what cpu is being used so also denotes what ports are available.
 *
 * Another way to handle this is with cpu functional ifdefs.  Ugly but
 * would work.  I think we really want the platform to provide SPI ports
 * which then determine what wires to what physical port.
 *
 * See msp430usci.h for port mappings.
