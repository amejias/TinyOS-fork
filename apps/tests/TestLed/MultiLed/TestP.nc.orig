/** Multiple-LED test.

 * Twice per second, a counter will be incremented, and the counter
 * value depicted in the LEDs.  The value of the counter, and the
 * value read from the LEDs, will be printed.  Verify that the LEDs
 * light in order to represent the counter value.  Watch the serial
 * output to ensure the counter and led value match in their lower
 * bits.
